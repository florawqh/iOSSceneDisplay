The eastern part of the Sanya bay is the south edge of Sanya downtown area. This part of the beach is a best place for local people to have morning exercises and dancing practice at nights because there are several squares or gardens in this part. It is also suitable for taking a casual stroll along the beach with a pair of slippers in the morning or at the evening for the local people or tourists who want to have fun on beach and enjoy the convenience of being close to dynamic downtown life. Along the western part of Sanya bay lies the 17.8-kilometer Palm Tree Dream Avenue. On one side of the avenue is the area for star-rated hotels and modern beach-front residential blocks. On the other side of the avenue is the dream-like palm-fringed beach which is not as crowded as the beaches in Dadonghai Bay or Yalong Bay. You can also have a swim light-heartedly here in the save area in the sea marked by the star-rated hotels nearby",
